{- For a list of length n, the number of merges is
   n/2 + n/4 + n/8 + ... + n/n
We need to put merge into account. This yields
   n/2 + n(log2)/4 + n(log4)/8 + ... + n(log(n)-1)/n
==>
   n/2 + nlog2 * sum(x/2^(x+1)) | x <- [1..logn]
The sum converges to 1, so it runs in O(n) time.

In contrast, fold gives O(nlog(n)) runtime. 
   log1 + log2 + log3 + log4 + ... + logn
==>
   log(n!), which is O(nlogn) -}

{-
I don't see any advantages of mergeT in a lazy environment, I suspect
my mergeT function is wrong. On the other hand, the original merge
function seems to exploit lazyness quite well. I mean if you visit
a leftist heap top-down, the subtrees are generated on demand.

For a concurrent environment, I'm sorry... I see none. But again,
the original merge function can generate subtrees in parallel.

I'm totally lost in exercise 3.4.
