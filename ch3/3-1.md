PROOF:
======

Suppose a leftist heap of size `n` with `r` nodes on its right path.
The proof is by induction. If `r = 1`, there must be at least one tree
node. Thus we have `n >= 2^r - 1`.    --[Equation 1]

Otherwise, suppose that [Equation 1] holds for `[1..r]`. Consider a
leftist tree with `r+1` nodes on its right path. Then the root has a
right subtree with `r` nodes on its right path, and a left subtree with
at least `r` nodes on its right path. Applying [Equation 1] to both
subtrees yields a minimum of `2^r - 1` nodes in each subtree. This gives
at least `2^(r+1) - 1` nodes in the tree.

Now we know `n(r) >= 2^r - 1` holds for each `r`. Solving the inequation
gives us `r <= log(n+1)`, proof done.
